# WordCloud
Python program to create a wordcloud out of a wikipedia web link.

Var 'list_stopwords' should be the only thing that needs to be changed with each different wiki page, everything else should work fine.

To change the aesthetics of the wordcloud, only the WordCloud function should be edited, I recommend using the [WordCloud official documentation](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/references.html) for this.

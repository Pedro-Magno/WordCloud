# WordCloud
    Python program to create a wordcloud out of a wikipedia web link.
    To change the aesthetics of the wordcloud , only the WordCloud function should be edited, recommend using the official documentation for that: https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/references.html
    Var 'list_stopwords' should be the only thing that needs to be changed with each different wiki page, everything else should work fine.
